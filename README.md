# Restaurant-Page
restaurant page based off of Odin project curriculum. Page is a desert-themed parody of normal restaurant pages with some tongue-in-cheek menu dishes. Used opportunity to learn about importing external libraries, such as jquery, parallax.js, and google maps api.

Happy with homepage parallax effect though the screen sizing could have been much better. Would have been nice to have enough tabs to implement a smooth-scroll 
on the homepage too. Menu page is nice and simple and happy with the way the menu items were organized in the .js file. Could have included hover-over images, but
due to pardoy nature of dishes, options would be limited for images. Contact page was for experimenting with google maps and pretty happy with the results. Used
online tutorials to figure out how to animate form, but still don't understand it completely.

In the future would like to implement more features and find a more efficient way of loading/removing webpages. Fading effects for switching between tabs is very much duct-tape and chewing gum, and would prefer to have a single module or library responsible for controlling fading effects.
