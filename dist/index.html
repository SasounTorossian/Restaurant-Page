        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>le Désert Aride was founded by 2 lost tourists name John Doe and David Guetta, along with their guide Mohammed bin Abubakr. After surviving for multiple days on nothing but insects and camel testicles, the three adventures decided to open up a chain of restaurants throughout the world's deserts. Today, their dream of exquisite desert food has come to life, with locations in the Sahara, Namib, Gobi, and other such deserts.</p>
